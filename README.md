Control Access of Arduino YÚN with MySQL, PHP5 and Python

Hello Friends!

Well, as you know, in September the new premiere shield  of Arduino, Arduino YUN. This little friend has a Linux embedded system with which we can run anything you can think of (at least so far).

While there is very little information on this new board, with departure in the guide that provides the Arduino page (which will link later), plus a little knowledge of many Linux, can carry out a major project a Control Access.

This time I will explain how to do this project, but in a manner sufficient particular all through our Arduino. This works, thanks a database server MySQL which will settle in our YUN, this database will store two tables, one for users associated with a particular RFID and another table to keep records of all cards that have passed through our reader. While we use programming languages ​​PHP and Python scripts to perform some basic and work with our data.

Moreover, the hardware overhead, we use a reader ID-20 next to a Serial LCD of 16 characters, plus an RGB LED which will be our informant states.

We may use this access control everything we can think of, modify, and add a relay or another idea. It can be used on anything where you have cards and want a record.

Recall that this document is free publication, commercial use and exempt modifications are not allowed. I hope it's a way more extensive path of Open Source electronics.
